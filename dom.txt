DOM - Document Object Model
- is a JS representation of a webpage
- JS window into the contents of a webpage
- JS controls HTML and CSS

1. The Document object: 
- When a browser loads a webpage, part of the loading process is taking
HTML and CSS objects and creating JS objects, so that it can be controlled with JS
- HTML file is structured as tree structure, Document object is the root node in that tree


2. Selecting object:
- document.getElementById("<idOfTheObject>): pick element
- document.getElementsByTagName("<tag>")
- document.getElementsByClassName("<class>")

- Better way: querySelector 
    + newer, all-in-one method to select a single element
    + recent addition to DOM
document.querySelector('a[<attribute>])

document.querySelectorAll: returns a collection of matching elements 
document.querySelectorAll("<selector>")
